cumulus (1.0.7) precise; urgency=low

  * * New     - added API selector      - api cannot be changed if a new
    location was searched     - temperature / speed is calculated when
    weather is downloaded based on user selection and downloaded
    temperature / speed units     - added function for temperature unit
    - added ubuntu condensed font for international languages support
    - added weather description     - added link in credits page for
    Open Weather Map provider     - added weather description in system
    language     - cumulus.desktop file     - snapcraft.yaml file
    * Changed     - ui is now flexible, the ui items aren't absolute
    positioned anymore(this can help for future widget resizing option)
    - changed ubuntu condensed font with the newer version everywhere it
    was used      - changed behavior of sync button, the weather should
    be shown after the sync has finished completely      - increased
    weather update from 15 mins to 60 mins (because weather doesn't
    usually changes so drastically in so little time span), weather
    update on demand still works     - fixed issue where default
    settings were not set on first run     - settings and sync button
    arer hidden on first run     - changed a bit font size and margins
    of detail divs to fit      - moved javascript code in different
    source files and named accordingly to be more readable     - changed
    schema to match cumulus project     - changed setup.py completely
    with a standard script     - fixed issue where the script for open
    weather map calculated the weather speed wrong      - changed the
    way weather updates inteval because the interval was never
    resetting, just creating more update intervals in case operations
    such as (changed location / api / measurements), now it should
    properly update the weather on an hour basis since last update     -
    hidden How To and Support buttons until we add something to them
    * Known Issues     - gradient background not setting correctly based
    on weather     - location might bug out when toggling through API
    and / or changing weather temperature / speed units(looking into it)
    - weather still fades in before weather is updated when loader
    button has been clicked, on new location, sometimes     - weather
    loader button(with tick) sometimes remains visible after location
    has been changed
